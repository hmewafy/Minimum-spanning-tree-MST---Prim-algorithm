# Minimum spanning tree-MST---Prim's-algorithm

This release is the minimum spanning tree (MST) functionality, used to compute the optimal “stadium roads network.” This ensures that each stadium is reachable from any other stadium with minimal total distance.
• Stadiums are represented as nodes.
• The dictionary of distances (e.g{('s1, 's2'): 5, ('s1', s3): 10, ...}) represents the weighted edges.
• apply Prim’s algorithm to find the MST
